Learning from mentors' experiences is a powerful way to gain insights and knowledge that can help us in our own personal and professional development. When we listen to the stories of successful people who have gone through similar experiences, we can learn from their mistakes, successes, and failures, and apply these lessons to our own journey.

The initiative of the CNCF Students to share the stories of great minds in the cloud native journey is an excellent opportunity to learn from these experiences. The program aims to gather stories from successful professionals who have taken a similar path, starting as students and working their way up to becoming experts in their field.

Through these stories, students can learn about the challenges that these professionals faced, the obstacles they overcame, and the strategies they used to succeed. They can gain insight into the skills, attitudes, and behaviors that contributed to their success, and apply these lessons to their own journey.

By learning from the experiences of others, students can avoid common pitfalls and mistakes, accelerate their learning, and gain the confidence and inspiration they need to pursue their own goals. The initiative of the CNCF Students is a great way to support students in their journey towards becoming experts in the field of cloud native computing.
