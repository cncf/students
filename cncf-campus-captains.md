# CNCF Campus Captains Program

Are you a Cloud Native & community enthusiast? We would love to have you join the CNCF Campus Captains Program! We believe that Open Source is a great way for students to learn, collaborate, and get real-world experience from the comfort of their homes. As a CNCF Campus Captain, you'll be starting a CNCF Student Community under the global [CNCF Student community](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-students/) for your local group/university. You'll get to be a part of a large network of Cloud Native students who are there to support you and the work that you do for the community. 

## What we look for
Student at any higher education institution
Passionate about building communities
Active in any of the Cloud Native projects either as a contributor/event organiser
Good communication skills
Additional Open Source & community experiences are appreciated

## Responsibilities

As a CNCF Campus Captain, you'll be responsible for sharing about various Cloud Native technologies and helping students getting started with and growing on their Open Source journey. This can be achieved via conducting webinars, workshops, taking courses together, events such as a hackathon, anything that you feel would benefit your community members.
We also encourage you to have third party speakers such as experienced mentors from the industry interact with the students. You can do this by collaborating with other CNCF communities or reaching out to the [Speakers Bureau](https://www.cncf.io/speakers/). You can also help your community members enhance their skills and apply them in real-world projects. This can be done via sharing learning resources such as coursework, events, helping them get started as a contributor in a particular project, etc.
Note that these are just a few of the examples, you can experiment and try out new things you build your community and empower its members. You can find more ideas or add your own in the [Program Ideas doc](https://github.com/cncf/students/blob/main/program-ideas.md).

## Support from CNCF
To support your work, you'll be receiving the following support from CNCF:
Swag for events # TBD until tomorrow
Support getting speakers
Mentorship for leading a community
Coupons for CNCF events
Private CNCF Student Ambassadors Slack channel for questions/queries

## Campus Captains Check in
We'll have CNCF Campus Captains calls where you'll get to meet other captains from around the world and share the good work that you are doing. During these calls, we'll be discussing how to scale your communities, ideas for events, and best practices to follow. It's also a place to ask questions, give/receive feedback, and learn from others. You will also have the opportunity to engage with other Campus Captains at CNCF events like [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon](https://www.cncf.io/kubecon-cloudnativecon-events/).
