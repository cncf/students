# CNCF Student Program Ideas
This page gives a list of program ideas, resources, meeting ideas, and groups to get students involved in the cloud native ecosystem.   Students going through these programs will be able to gain experience using cloud-native technologies for their future jobs and develop skills to contribute to open-source projects.

### Contributing to open source projects
 Students who want to become contributors to open-source projects in the cloud-native ecosystem can find more information on the [contributor page](https://contribute.cncf.io/).

### Working on a cloud native thesis
A college student can focus their thesis on a project that involves the implementation or a test drive of cloud-native technologies that solve real-life problems or demonstrate different use cases for cloud-native technologies.

### Cloud native class projects
A professor can design a project that solves a real-world problem and/or shows how to use cloud-native technologies. The professor can explore ideas such as:
- Test new features for an specific CNCF project
- Implement a solution that solves a real life problem
- Develop new features for a CNCF project
 
### Open Syllabus
Professors can work on open content of their courses and start to include CNCF technologies into their classes and projects, generating content as workshops, tutorials, etc.
 
## Student Program Examples
Below are some examples of how students around the world have grown within the cloud native community. Do you have an example that you would like to share? Please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/cncf/students/pulls) to add it. 

### Students Presenting a Class Project
The students of USAC, University of Guatemala presented a project about a high concurrency system that displays real time information about Covid-19, this project used cloud native technologies such as Kubernetes, Linkerd, gRPC, Prometheus, and others. Charles Pretzer from Linkerd Community and Field Engineer of Buoyant, helped answer questions and invited students to join the Linkerd Community.

### Open Syllabus and project
This repository is an initiative to develop an open content and resources for students to learn about cloud native technologies.

### CNCF Students Day
CNCF Students Day was hosted in Nicaragua as an online event to promote CNCF technologies. Students from Guatemala and other speakers who are organizers of CNCF Community Groups participated by giving workshops and talks focused on containers, Kubernetes, and cloud-native in general.
